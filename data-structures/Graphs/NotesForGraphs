What is a graph??
data stored as a bunch of nodes with connections between those nodes - real world examples are: 
maps (locations that link to other locations along roads, paths, etc), 
social media network connections, 
networks of webpages that link to other webpages (like Wikipedia),
AI recommendations on websites/apps

Vertex is a node
Edge is a connection between two nodes

linked lists and trees are technically types of graphs because they have nodes with connections!
however, with a tree, there is only one possible path from one node to another. 
with a generic graph there may be more than one path

undirected graph: unlike a singly linked list, there is no distinct direction from one node to another
the relationship goes both ways

directed graph is like a bunch of one way roads between the vertices. 
or like instagram or twitter where users follow a celebrity and the celebrity may not follow them back

weighted vs unweighted graph: when we assign value to the edges the UNweighted graph becomes a weighted graph


how do you traverse a graph when there is no distinct entrypoint? we just to specify our start point in the algorithm
-- we need to visit/update/check each node/vertex (at least for starters)

BFS - we traverse all neighbors before we traverse the neighbors' neighbors. distance between nodes is "height"
if nodes are adjacent we say they have a height of 1. if there is a node between two nodes they have a height of 2

Max Binary Heap:
root is always the largest
each parent has at most two children.
children of node are always smaller in value than the parent. 
no relationship between siblings (unlike a binary search tree where right node must be larger than left node)

Min binary heap is the opposite:
root is always the smallest
children of node are always larger in value than the parent. 
once again, no relationship between siblings 

a binary heap is as compact as possible: all children of each node are as full as they can be (while still adhering to the rules)
left children are filled out first

heaps are commonly used with Priority Queues and graph traversal

removal from a heap means extracting the root (top node) and then re-settling the rest of the heap. also called sink down, 
down heap, bubble down, percolate down and a slew of other things.

Big O for Stacks & Queues (reminder that stacks are LIFO / queues are FIFO):

Insertion/Removal O(1) - constant time
(if we have a LOT of data, we will always add/remove from front of stack for constant time, 
in this case we would use a SLL instead of an array

for queues we will add to tail and remove from head for superior Big O

)

Searching and Accessing O(N) - we don't really use search/access in stacks or queues

Big O of SLLs (as compared to arrays):

Insertion: O(1) time
- for arrays: O(N) bc to insert you'll have to re-index the entire array. particularly if you are inserting towards the beginning.

Removal: if removing from beginning, O(1). Otherwise O(N) because you may have to iterate thru up to one whole time
Arrays: O(N) same as above

Searching: O(N) could be last or second to last item. but will only have to iterate once.
Arrays: O(1) because of indexing (indexOf)

Access: same as Searching
Arrays: O(1) same as Searching

Remember: SLLs aren't indexed. Elements are connected to each other thru their .next
